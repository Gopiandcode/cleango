# CLeanGo - Bindings to libclingo for Lean 4

This repository includes bindings to the Clingo ASP programming system
for the Lean 4 Theorem Prover.

The bindings are currently work in progress, but the final goal is to
have a DSL from which you can write Clingo queries in Lean and have then sent
directly to Clingo and their results returned in a Lean format.


Using: https://github.com/Anderssorby/SDL.lean/blob/main/bindings/sdl2-shim.c and https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/include/lean/lean.h for reference
